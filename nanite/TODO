TODO:

- The examples/crew.rb file is pointing towards a hard coded user dir.  Needs to be
documented as part of a working example.
- examples/async_rack_front/async_rack_front.ru needs to be documented and verified working.

Ian:
  - Sync Mapper/Agent#start with nanite-mapper/agent
  - Update docs for Agent#start and Mapper#start
  - Update docs in nanite-agent and nanite-mapper
  - Ensure file transfer works
  - Check secure stuff still works
  - Check custom status_proc works
  - Check documentation, only document public methods
  - ensure the removal of threaded_actors option doesn't cause shit to block

  - Look into using EM deferables for actors dispatch.
  - Integration specs that spawn a small cluster of nanites
  - Rename Ping to Status
  - request/push should take *args for payload?

Maybe:
  - Make mapper queue durable and Results respect :persistent flag on the request
  - Add a global result received callback
