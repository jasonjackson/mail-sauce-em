This example demonstrates how to setup Nanite so that every packet is encrypted
and signed using X.509 certificates and RSA cryptographic keys.

To run it:
  1. Make sure you have AMQP setup properly (same setup as simpleagent example)
  2. run a secure agent ('nanite-agent --token secure --format secure')
  3. run ./cli.rb

This will send a request to the agent telling it to print some output using
the Nanite secure serializer.
