This example demonstrates the ability for agents to send requests to other agents.

To run it:
  1. Make sure you have AMQP setup properly (same setup as simpleagent example)
  2. run a simple agent ('nanite-agent --token fred') in examples/simpleagent
  2. run 'nanite-agent --token client' in this folder
  3. run ./cli.rb

This will send a request to the client agent telling it to send a request to
the /simple/echo operation exposed by the simple agent.
