Mail Sauce

Description:

Mail Sauce is the beginning of a distributed email newsletter system which utilizes:

Nanite - http://github.com/ezmobius/nanite

Tenjin - http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/

Redis - http://code.google.com/p/redis/

EventMachine - http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org




Usage:

Start the mapper:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ./start_mapper.rb


Start RabbitMQ:

root@sfqload01  ~
# rabbitmq-server


Start Redis:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ redis-server


Start an agent or ten:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ../../bin/nanite-agent --token a -l debug -h sfqload01 --single-threaded --prefetch 1


Start Alice and Wonderland:

rabbitmq@sfqload01  /alice
$ ./start.sh -alice rabbithost "rabbit@sfqload01" -setcookie `cat /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie`

* Note that alice must run as the user rabbitmq.


Send a list:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ./send.rb -l edu_spouse_v_half2a

At the moment sending a list is specific to my environment.  You can see what is going on in send.rb, but basically it is pulling a list down from mysql and then splitting that into a determined size which is issued to Nanite.push.


This is very much a first pass at things, lots of bad code, just trying to get an idea into some code and learn a bit more about the tech that im using to build this thing out of.  I have run into a few issues that happen in certain situations which i will discuss on my blog (url below) that may determine whether the technology used in this tool makes sense for you.  Hit me up at:

http://dotrb.com and ping Jason Jackson (me)  or the site admin (me).
