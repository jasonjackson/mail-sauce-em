Usage:

Start the mapper:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ./start_mapper.rb


Start RabbitMQ:

root@sfqload01  ~
# rabbitmq-server


Start Redis:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ redis-server


Start an agent or ten:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ../../bin/nanite-agent --token a -l debug -h sfqload01 --single-threaded --prefetch 1


Start Alice and Wonderland:

rabbitmq@sfqload01  /alice
$ ./start.sh -alice rabbithost "rabbit@sfqload01" -setcookie `cat /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie`

* Note that alice must run as the user rabbitmq.


Send a list:

jjackson@sfqload01  /systems/mail_injection
$ ./send.rb -l edu_spouse_v_half2a

At the moment sending a list is specific to my employers environment.  You can see what is going on in send.rb, but basically it is pulling a list down from mysql and then splitting that into a determined size which is issued to push.
